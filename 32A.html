        <h1>ECS 32A Tutoring</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to CS Peer Tutoring! Every quarter, the CS Tutoring
            Committee organizes undergraduate volunteer tutors to help students
            with undergraduate CS courses. All tutors are approved by the CS
            department, and received high grades in the courses they tutor.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, you can find the hours for all of our ECS
            32A tutors this quarter. We show tutoring hours for
            the next 7 days. If this page is not loading correctly, you can
            always see the full list of tutors <a
            href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ucdcstutoring@gmail.com&mode=WEEK&ctz=America/Los_Angeles&pli=1">here</a>
            (which lists tutors for all courses).
        </p>
        <p>
            CS tutoring is free for all students --- just head down to Kemper
            75 (in the basement of Kemper Hall, look for signs pointing to the
            CSIF) at one of the times shown below and sign in on the whiteboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that tutors may show up a few minutes after the listed
            time here (eg. if they have a class beforehand). Contact
            ucdcstutoring@gmail.com with any questions.
